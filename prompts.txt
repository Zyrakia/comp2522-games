This project has been quite the short but gruesome journey. Minecraft sparked my love for programming back in the day,
so I wanted to pay homage, but I also love merge games, so I wanted to create a really grindy merge game that takes
inspiration from Minecraft crafting mechanics.

I used AI throughout this project to quickly get me out of roadblocks. I wanted the idea to stay my own though. While
implementing, it was super helpful to be able to use ChatGPT as a sort of "documentation browser", JavaFX documentation
is pretty sparse, especially the CSS side, so that was absolutely the biggest help.

ChatGPT often led me in the wrong direction though. It often didn't understand the complex UI structure I had created.
Sometimes it would try creating whole new classes, reference methods that did not exist, or even just tell me the wrong
information.

For example, getting the item to follow the mouse cursor required a lot of tinkering by myself, because ChatGPT
kept trying to convince me that a transparent pane could capture mouse events, which it can't.
